# Lab Task 9: Implementing an LR Bottom-Up Parser

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and implement an LR Bottom-Up Parser for a given grammar in Python. The parser will analyze and validate strings based on a specified set of production rules.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of Context-Free Grammars (CFGs).
- Basics of Lexical Analysis and Tokenization.
- Knowledge of Shift-Reduce Parsing and LR Parsing Tables.
- Familiarity with Stacks and State Transitions.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Define the Grammar
1. Choose a simple grammar:
   ```
   S → CC
   C → cC | d
   ```
2. Represent the grammar rules in Python using dictionaries or lists.

### Task 2: Construct the Parsing Table
- Manually construct the Action and Goto tables for the given grammar.

### Task 3: Implement the Parsing Algorithm
- Use a stack to simulate the parsing process.
- Implement the Shift and Reduce operations.
- Stop when the input is successfully parsed or an error is encountered.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Initialize a stack with the start state.
2. Read input symbols one by one.
3. Based on the parsing table, perform:
   - **Shift**: Push the symbol and transition state onto the stack.
   - **Reduce**: Replace symbols on the stack based on a production rule.
4. If the stack contains the start symbol and reaches an accept state, the input is accepted.

### Task 4: Run the Parser on Test Inputs
- Test with different strings:
  - **Valid**: `ccd`
  - **Invalid**: `ccc`

## Implementation
The parser will be implemented in Python, following the steps outlined above. The program will read input strings, utilize the parsing table, and determine if the strings are valid according to the grammar.

### Example Input
```plaintext
ccd
```

### Example Output
```plaintext
Parsing successful: The input string is accepted by the grammar.
```

### Notes
- Ensure that the parser correctly implements the shift and reduce operations.
- The parsing table should be constructed accurately to reflect the grammar's rules.
- Handle errors gracefully, providing feedback for invalid input strings.
